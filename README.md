# Boolean Algebras

Brief notes covering the elementary theory of Boolean algebras, Boolean rings, and Stone spaces (compact, Hausdorff and totally disconnected topological spaces).

We end these notes with the definition of a pair of adjoint functors relating the categories of Boolean algebras and of Stone spaces.
